# Bachelor-Thesis
Diffusion simulation by random walks

This little softvare is a part of the bachelor's thesis of Stefan Hnat.

Computer language and version: Python 3.6

At first I find it appropriate to mention, that I am not a professional softvare engineer. I've had only a basic course in structural programming for scientific purposes. Please, be aware that the available scripts are raw material used as sort of experimental apparatus to gather simulation dataset. 

### Dependencies
* interpreter - [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* visualisation of data - [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/)

If you want to try the program functionality on your system, run the script "[run.py](hyperlink to be added)".
